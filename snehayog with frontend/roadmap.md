## 🗺️ MVP Roadmap (Step-by-Step)

### 📦 PHASE 1: Project Setup

1. **Set up Flutter App**
   - `flutter create snehayog`
   - Add bottom navigation bar (Shorts, Videos, Upload, Profile)

2. **Backend Setup**
   - Node.js server with Express
   - Setup MongoDB Atlas DB
   - REST API structure (MVC pattern)
   - Use `multer` to handle video uploads

3. **User Auth (Google Sign-In)**
   - Google Sign-In in Flutter
   - Backend verifies token, stores user in DB
   - Use JWT to protect API

---

### 🎬 PHASE 2: Core Features

#### 🔹 1. **Short Video Feed (Reels-style)**

- Vertical swipeable video screen (`PageView`)
- Like, Share, Save, Comment buttons
- Backend: `/api/videos/shorts` → returns short videos
- Video model: `{url, uploaderId, caption, likes, comments, createdAt}`

#### 🔹 2. **Long Video Feed (like YouTube)**

- Horizontal scroll list of videos (thumbnails)
- Video player page with full video, description, and like/comment
- Backend: `/api/videos/long`

#### 🔹 3. **Upload Video (Short or Long)**

- Button to select video
- Compression (optional)
- Upload to server (using `dio`)
- Choose "Short" or "Long" in upload screen
- Store video on S3/Firebase; store metadata in MongoDB

#### 🔹 4. **Profile Screen (like Instagram)**

- Show username, profile pic, follower count
- Tabs: Shorts | Longs
- Show uploaded videos
- Backend: `/api/users/:id`, `/api/videos/byUser/:id`

---

### 💸 PHASE 3: Monetization System

#### 🔹 1. Integrate Google AdMob

- Add rewarded and banner ads
- Show banner ads in video detail page
- Show interstitial ad after X number of views

#### 🔹 2. Track Ad Views per Video

- Track video watch time / ads seen
- Store ad impressions or earnings in DB per creator

#### 🔹 3. Revenue Model Logic

- Backend calculates:
```js
earning = totalRevenue * 0.80  // For creator
```
- Store creator earnings in a separate collection:
```js
{
  userId,
  earnings: 45.00,
  lastPayoutDate: "2025-04-01",
  views: 10000
}
```

#### 🔹 4. Creator Dashboard (Basic)

- Show total earnings
- Withdraw button (for now, just mark as "Requested")
- Later, integrate Razorpay / Stripe for real payouts

---

### 🚀 PHASE 4: Polish and Prepare to Launch MVP

- Test video compression and upload on low-end devices
- Add loading spinners, error handling
- Use lazy loading / pagination for video lists
- Add basic analytics (Firebase or custom)
- Prepare for TestFlight / Play Store alpha release
