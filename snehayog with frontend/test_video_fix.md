# Video Playback Fix Test Guide

## Problem Description
Videos in the profile screen show "video playback error" on the first attempt but work on retry.

## Root Cause
Race condition between video controller initialization and video player widget setup, causing the first initialization to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in VideoPlayerWidget
- Added retry logic for first-time initialization failures
- Added timeout handling to prevent hanging initialization
- Added fallback URL support when HLS conversion fails
- Improved user feedback with retry buttons

### 2. Race Condition Prevention in VideoControllerManager
- Added initialization locks to prevent multiple simultaneous initializations
- Added proper cleanup of failed controllers
- Added validation of existing controllers before reuse

### 3. Graceful Error Recovery in VideoScreen
- Added timeout handling for video initialization
- Added automatic retry logic with delays
- Added user-friendly error messages with retry options

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: First-Time Video Playback
1. Navigate to profile screen
2. Tap on any video thumbnail
3. **Expected**: Video should load and play without errors
4. **If error occurs**: Should show retry button and fallback options

### Test 2: Error Recovery
1. If video shows error, tap "Retry" button
2. **Expected**: Video should load successfully on retry
3. **Alternative**: Try "Try Original URL" if HLS fails

### Test 3: Multiple Video Navigation
1. Play a video successfully
2. Navigate to next/previous video
3. **Expected**: Smooth transitions without initialization errors

### Test 4: Profile Screen Navigation
1. Go to profile screen
2. Navigate away and back
3. Try playing videos again
4. **Expected**: Consistent playback behavior

## Feature Flags

The fix is controlled by the `profile_video_playback_fix` feature flag:
- **Enabled**: Uses enhanced error handling and retry logic
- **Disabled**: Uses original behavior

## Debug Information

Check console logs for:
- `üé¨ VideoPlayerWidget: Starting controller initialization...`
- `üîÑ VideoPlayerWidget: First initialization failed, retrying...`
- `‚úÖ VideoPlayerWidget: Initialization complete!`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è VideoScreen: Video initialization may have timed out, retrying...`

## Performance Impact

- **First attempt**: Slightly slower due to retry logic
- **Subsequent attempts**: Faster due to cached controllers
- **Overall**: More reliable playback with better user experience

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, disable the feature flag:
```dart
Features.profileVideoPlaybackFix.isEnabled = false;
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Videos play successfully on first attempt from profile screen
‚úÖ Error recovery works smoothly with retry options
‚úÖ No regression in existing video functionality
‚úÖ Improved user experience with clear error messages
