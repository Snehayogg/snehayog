snehayog/
├── backend/                # Node.js backend
├── frontend/               # Flutter app

## 🛠️ Manual Setup Steps

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd snehayog
```

### 2️⃣ Verify Folder Structure

Make sure you have this structure:
```bash
cd snehayog
ls -la
# You should see:
# - backend/
# - frontend/

```

If `packages/snehayog_monetization` is missing, the Flutter app will NOT build!

cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run

## ❗ Troubleshooting

### Issue: `flutter pub get` fails with "Could not find package snehayog_monetization"

**Solution:**

1. Check if `snehayog_monetization` folder exists in packages:
   ```bash
   cd snehayog
   ls -la packages/
   # You should see snehayog_monetization/
   ```

2. If missing, make sure you cloned the ENTIRE repository including all folders

3. Verify the path in `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   snehayog_monetization:
     path: ../packages/snehayog_monetization  # Relative to frontend/
   ```

4. Run setup again:
   ```bash
   cd snehayog/frontend
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Issue: Backend connection fails

**Solution:**

1. Make sure backend is running:
   ```bash
   cd snehayog/backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Check `app_config.dart` has correct backend URL:
   ```dart
   static String get baseUrl => 
       kIsWeb ? 'https://snehayog-production.up.railway.app'
       : 'http://192.168.0.190:5001';  // Your local IP
   ```
