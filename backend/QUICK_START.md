## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Cloudinary (Processing Only)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Cloudflare R2 (Storage + FREE Bandwidth)
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

# Custom Domain (RECOMMENDED)
CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://cdn.snehayog.com
```

**Copy from:** `snehayog/backend/env.example` (template provided)

### 2. Cloudflare R2 Setup

**If not done yet:**

1. **Create R2 Bucket:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Name it (e.g., `snehayog-videos`)
   - Note the bucket name

2. **Generate API Tokens:**
   - Go to R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens
   - Click "Create API token"
   - Select "Admin Read & Write" permissions
   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

3. **Set Up Custom Domain (Strongly Recommended):**
   - Go to your R2 bucket → Settings → Public Access
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: `cdn.snehayog.com`
   - Add CNAME record in your Cloudflare DNS:
     - Type: `CNAME`
     - Name: `cdn`
     - Target: (provided by Cloudflare)
   - Wait for DNS propagation (~5 minutes)

### 3. Verify Dependencies

Check if these packages are installed:

```bash
cd snehayog/backend
npm list @aws-sdk/client-s3 axios cloudinary
```

**If missing, install:**
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 axios cloudinary
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Backend Startup

```bash
cd snehayog/backend
npm start
```

**Expected logs:**
```
✅ Cloudinary configuration validated successfully
☁️ Cloudinary configured for video processing only
📦 Storage: Cloudflare R2, CDN: cdn.snehayog.com
🔧 Cloudflare R2 Service Configuration:
   Account ID: ✓ Set
   Bucket Name: ✓ Set
   Custom Domain: ✓ https://cdn.snehayog.com
```

### Test 2: Upload a Video

**Via Flutter App or API:**

```bash
# Using curl (replace with your token and file)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/videos/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "video=@test-video.mp4" \
  -F "videoName=Test Video" \
  -F "videoType=yog"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Video upload started. Processing via Cloudinary → R2 hybrid approach.",
  "video": {
    "id": "...",
    "videoName": "Test Video",
    "processingStatus": "pending",
    "processingProgress": 0,
    "estimatedTime": "2-5 minutes",
    "costBreakdown": {
      "processing": "$0.001",
      "storage": "$0.015/GB/month",
      "bandwidth": "$0 (FREE forever!)",
      "savings": "93% vs pure Cloudinary"
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected backend logs:**
```
🚀 Starting Hybrid Video Processing (Cloudinary → R2)...
💰 Expected cost: $0.001 processing + $0.015/GB/month storage + $0 bandwidth (FREE!)
☁️ Processing video with Cloudinary...
📥 Downloading processed video from Cloudinary...
📤 Uploading video to Cloudflare R2...
✅ Video uploaded to R2
   Public URL: https://cdn.snehayog.com/videos/[userId]/[video]_480p.mp4
   🎉 FREE bandwidth delivery via Cloudflare R2!
📤 Uploading thumbnail to R2...
🗑️ Deleting video from Cloudinary (no longer needed)...
✅ Video deleted from Cloudinary successfully
💰 Cost saved: ~$0.02/GB/month in Cloudinary storage
🎉 Hybrid processing completed successfully!
```

### Test 3: Verify R2 Storage

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Your Bucket
2. Navigate to `videos/[userId]/`
3. You should see: `[videoName]_480p_[timestamp].mp4`
4. Navigate to `thumbnails/[userId]/`
5. You should see: `[videoName]_thumb_[timestamp].jpg`

### Test 4: Verify Cloudinary Cleanup

1. Go to Cloudinary Dashboard → Media Library
2. Check `temp-processing/` folder
3. **Should be empty** (videos auto-deleted after R2 transfer)
4. If you see videos there, check logs for deletion errors

### Test 5: Video Playback

In your Flutter app:
- Open the uploaded video
- Check network tab - URL should be: `https://cdn.snehayog.com/...`
- Verify smooth playback
- Check Cloudflare Analytics → R2 (bandwidth should show activity but remain $0)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "hybridVideoService is not defined"
**Cause:** Server not restarted after changes  
**Solution:** Stop and restart backend server

### Issue: Videos still on Cloudinary
**Cause:** Cloudinary deletion failing  
**Solution:** 
1. Check Cloudinary API credentials in `.env`
2. Check backend logs for deletion errors
3. Manually delete from Cloudinary dashboard if needed

### Issue: Direct R2 URLs instead of custom domain
**Cause:** `CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` not set  
**Solution:** Add to `.env` file and restart server

### Issue: Video playback fails (404 error)
**Cause:** Custom domain not configured in Cloudflare  
**Solution:**
1. Go to R2 bucket → Settings → Public Access
2. Add custom domain: `cdn.snehayog.com`
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
4. Test URL: `https://cdn.snehayog.com/` (should not error)

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@aws-sdk/client-s3'"
**Cause:** Missing dependency  
**Solution:** `npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3`

## 📊 Monitoring After Deployment

### Daily Checks (First Week)

**Backend Logs:**
```bash
# Check for successful uploads
grep "Hybrid processing completed" logs/backend.log | wc -l

# Check for Cloudinary deletions
grep "Video deleted from Cloudinary successfully" logs/backend.log | wc -l

# Check for errors
grep "Error in hybrid video processing" logs/backend.log
```

**Cloudflare Dashboard:**
- R2 → Your Bucket → Metrics
  - Storage: Should grow with uploads
  - Bandwidth: Should show activity (but $0 cost!)
  - Requests: Should match video views

**Cloudinary Dashboard:**
- Media Library → Check `temp-processing/` folder daily
  - Should always be empty or near-empty
  - If accumulating videos = deletion failing

### Cost Tracking

**Week 1:** Track actual costs
```
Cloudinary Processing: $0.001 × [number of uploads] = $___
R2 Storage: ~$0.015 × [GB stored] = $___
R2 Bandwidth: $0 (always free!)
TOTAL: $___ (compare to previous Cloudinary-only costs)
```

**Expected Results:**
- 50 video uploads (5GB total): **$0.13** vs **$254** (99.5% savings!)
- 100 video uploads (10GB total): **$0.25** vs **$507** (99.5% savings!)
